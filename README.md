# Customer Booking Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer bookings using a Random Forest algorithm. The model analyzes customer data to predict whether a customer will make a booking. This can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies, enhance customer service, and improve overall efficiency.

## Features
- Predicts customer bookings with an accuracy of 85%+.
- Utilizes Random Forest algorithm for robust and reliable predictions.
- Easy-to-follow code and detailed documentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-booking-prediction.git
   cd customer-booking-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project should contain historical customer booking information, including relevant features such as:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Booking history (number of previous bookings, booking frequency, etc.)
- Interaction data (website visits, inquiries, etc.)

Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format and named `customer_data.csv`.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing `customer_data.csv` in the `data` directory.

2. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. Make predictions on new data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input new_customer_data.csv --output predictions.csv
   ```

## Model

The Random Forest algorithm is used for prediction. It is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification.

## Evaluation

The model achieves an accuracy of 85%+, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer bookings. Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy: 85%+
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
